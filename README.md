You can build a real-time chat application in Node.js using Express, Mongoose, and Socket.io¹. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser¹. The most important advantage of using Node is that we can use JavaScript as both a front-end and back-end language¹. You can install Node.js from their official website⁵.

To start building the chat application, you can create a new project directory and move into it. Then you can initiate your project by running the command `npm init`¹. This will prompt you to enter details about your project. After this, a `package.json` file will be created¹.

You can then install the required dependencies such as Express, Mongoose, and Socket.io by running the command `npm install --save express mongoose socket.io`¹. You can then start building your chat application using these libraries. You can find more detailed instructions on how to build a real-time chat application in Node.js in this tutorial¹.
